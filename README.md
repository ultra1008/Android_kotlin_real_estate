## About

Sample project that build with MVVM clean architure and various cool techs including RxJava3 and Coroutines Flow, Dynamic Feature modules as base of BottomNavigationView or ViewPager2, with both OfflineFirst and OfflineLast approaches as database Single Source of Truth and TDD.

Unit tests are written with JUnit4, JUnit5, MockK, Truth, MockWebServer.

## Overview
* Gradle Kotlin DSL is used for setting up gradle files with ```buildSrc``` folder and extensions.
* KtLint, Detekt, and Git Hooks is used for checking, and formatting code and validating code before commits.
* Dagger Hilt, Dynamic Feature Modules with Navigation Components, ViewModel, Retrofit, Room, RxJava, Coroutines libraries adn dependencies are set up.
* ```features``` and ```libraries``` folders are used to include android libraries and dynamic feature modules
* In core module dagger hilt dependencies and ```@EntryPoint``` is created
* Data module uses Retrofit and Room to provide Local and Remote data sources
* Repository provides offline and remote fetch function with mapping and local save, delete and fetch functions
* Domain module uses useCase classes to implment business logic to fetch and forward data
* ViewModel uses LiveData with data-binding to display LOADING, and ERROR or SUCCESS states.

## Built With ðŸ› 

Some of the popular libraries and MVVM clean architecture used with offline-first and offline-last with Room database and Retrofit as data source

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.

* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - Threads on steroids for Kotlin
* [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
* [RxJava3](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) - Newest version of famous reactive programming library for Java, and other languages
* [Android JetPack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  * [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  * [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) Navigate fragments as never easier before
  * [Dynamic Feature Modules](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/dynamic-delivery) Dynamic modules for adding or removing based on preference
* [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
* [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) -
  * [Hilt-Dagger](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
  * [Hilt-ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack) - DI for injecting `ViewModel`.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading library.
* [Lottie](http://airbnb.io/lottie) - animation library
